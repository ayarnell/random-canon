<!-- chapter title: DR. SCHOFIELD's OPINION -->

<p>In ten minutes we were in the streets of Little
Drayton again, and Cecil had brought the dog cart
to a standstill outside the “Rose and Crown.” He
would have gone in with me, but I begged him not
to. I jumped down and walked straight into the
little parlour. Milly was sitting there alone, gazing
absently into the fire. She looked up in surprise
at my sudden entrance, and half rose.</p>
<p>“Milly, I want to ask you a question,” I said,
going up to her side. “It’s about your father’s
disappearance.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” she exclaimed eagerly. “What is it?
Oh, do tell me quickly!”</p>
<p>“It’s only an idea. Did Mr. Hart ever suffer
from any brain disorder at any time? That’s all
I want to know. Has his mind always been quite
strong?”</p>
<p>She did not answer for a moment and my heart
beat fast. Looking at her closely, I could see that
the colour had flushed into her cheeks and there
was a troubled light in her eyes.</p>
<p>“He has had one or two severe illnesses,” she
admitted slowly; “brain fever once; and I’m
afraid he used to drink too much now and then.
The doctor told him that he must be very careful
not to excite himself.”</p>
<p>“Who was the doctor and where does he live?”
I asked quickly.</p>
<p>“Dr. Schofield. He lives on the Lincoln Road,
about a mile away. Why have you asked me
this?” she added anxiously.</p>
<p>I evaded a direct reply.</p>
<p>“Never mind now,” I said. “If anything comes
of it, I will let you know.”</p>
<p>She tried to detain me with further questions,
but I hurried away and she did not follow me out
of the door.</p>
<p>“Cis,” I said, as I scrambled up to his side, “I
want you to go home by the Lincoln Road and
call at Dr. Schofield’s. It isn’t far out of the way.”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“All right. You haven’t found out anything
about old Hart, have you? What was the question
you went back to ask Milly?”</p>
<p>“Only about her father’s health. No; I haven’t
found out anything. It’s only an idea of mine I
want to clear up.”</p>
<p>Cecil looked as though he thought I might have
told him what the idea was, but he said nothing.
In a few minutes he pulled up outside a neat, red-brick
house, which, as a shining brass plate indicated,
was Dr. Schofield’s abode.</p>
<p>The doctor was in and disengaged. He came
at once into the waiting-room, where I had been
shown—a respectable family practitioner, with intelligent
face and courteous manner.</p>
<p>I explained my position as an acquaintance of
Miss Hart’s, interested in the mysterious disappearance
of her father. It had occurred to me to make
inquiries as to the state of his health, or, rather,
his constitution, I added. Perhaps his prolonged
absence might be accounted for by sudden and
dangerous illness. Could Dr. Schofield give me any
information?</p>
<p>His manner was encouraging. He bade me take
a seat and went into the matter gravely.</p>
<p>“To tell you the truth,” he said, “I am rather
surprised that I have not been appealed to before.
In an ordinary case I should feel bound to maintain
a strict secrecy with regard to the ailments of my
patients, but this is different. As you have asked
me this question, I feel bound to tell you what I
would not otherwise divulge. Mr. Hart was my
patient on two several occasions during the last
two years for delirium tremens, and once within my
recollection he had a distinct touch of brain fever.”</p>
<p>“His mind would not be very strong, then?” I
remarked.</p>
<p>Dr. Schofield hesitated.</p>
<p>“He had a wonderful constitution,” he said
slowly—“a constitution of iron. In ordinary circumstances
I cannot bring myself to think that
he could suddenly and completely have lost his
reason. But supposing he had received some
severe shock, such as a railway accident, or something
of that sort, why, then it would be possible,
even probable, he might become a raving lunatic
in a moment.”</p>
<p>“And would his madness be incurable?”</p>
<p>“If properly treated, with a knowledge of his
past ailment—no,” answered Dr. Schofield; “but
if he were treated just like an ordinary madman
in a pauper lunatic asylum, he would probably
never recover. He would become worse and worse
and finally be incurable. I see two objections to
accepting any theory of this sort as accounting
for his disappearance,” the doctor continued, after
a short pause. “In the first place the shock would
have to be violent and unexpected, and this seems
improbable; in the next place, he would surely
have had some letter or something about him
which would have led to his identification!”</p>
<p>“If the shock were the result of foul play, these
would be destroyed,” I suggested.</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly; but whence the foul play?
Hart is known to have had only a few pounds
with him when he left.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he had something in his keeping more
valuable than money,” I remarked.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“A secret.”</p>
<p>“Have you any grounds for such a belief?” the
doctor asked curiously.</p>
<p>I hesitated. In my own mind I believed that I
had; but for the present, at any rate, this was
best kept to myself. I answered quite truthfully,
however.</p>
<p>“I have made a few inquiries here and there,”
I said, “and I have heard it hinted that he had
some secret means of replenishing his purse. He has
been known more than once to leave here with
only a few sovereigns in his pocket and to come
back with his sovereigns turned into banknotes.”</p>
<p>“I remember hearing some such tale,” the doctor
remarked. “I’m afraid it is all rather vague,
though.”</p>
<p>“I’m very much obliged to you, Dr. Schofield,”
I assured him, rising to take my leave.</p>
<p>He followed me to the door and then returned
to his interrupted dinner. I mounted into the
dog cart and we were soon bowling through the
darkness towards Borden Tower.</p>
<p>“Get anything out of the old chap?” Cecil
asked.</p>
<p>“Not much. I’m just a little wiser than I was
before, that’s all. Beastly sorry to keep you waiting
so long!”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s all right! But I say, Phil,” he
added, “what is this idea of yours? You can
tell me, can’t you?”</p>
<p>“If it comes to anything, I will,” I assured him.
“But at present it is altogether too vague and
you would only laugh at it. Don’t ask me anything
more about it yet, there’s a good fellow.”</p>
<p>“You’re very close, all of a sudden,” he grumbled.
“Why can’t you tell me?”</p>
<p>“Because I’m afraid of your letting it out to
someone whom I don’t want to know anything
about it,” I answered.</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>“Ah, well, perhaps you’re right!” he said.
“I couldn’t keep anything back from Milly.”</p>
<p>I echoed his laugh, but held my peace. It was
not Milly alone from whom I wished my present
idea to be kept a secret. In fact, I had not
thought of Milly at all. I was only anxious that
de Cartienne should remain altogether in the dark
as to my clue; and for a remarkably good reason.</p>
