<!-- Volume 1 Chapter 8 -->
<p>We were now at the end of our voyage, and had nothing further to seek than the opportunity of
making good our landing, the signal to prepare for which soon floated from the commodore’s masthead. Three days’ provisions were ordered to be cooked, and all boats to be got in readiness; while armed launches, and such vessels as drew the least water, were moved as near to the beach as seemed compatible with a due regard to their own safety. Meanwhile, the enemy were not idle. Their batteries along shore, both numerous and heavily armed, kept up an incessant fire, particularly upon our reconnoitering frigate the Leda, which never seemed to regard such salutations; while large masses of men showed themselves on the heights, as if determined to push us back into the sea. Nevertheless, the boats were manned and filled with troops; and the whole, rowing as close in-shore as the heavy surf would allow, there halted. I do not know why this move was made, for nothing came of it; indeed, after the loss of a barge and half a company of grenadiers, the whole of whom went down as soon as the boat upset, we were recalled by signal from the commodore, and returned each corps and troop to its respective vessel.</p>
<p>There had been several councils of war previous to this attempt—they were renewed apparently with fresh spirit as soon as the attempt failed; and it was determined by those in authority to divide the force, by sending a portion, with Brigadier-General Beresford at their head, round to Saldana bay. It chanced that the 20th Light Dragoons formed part of General Beresford’s detachment, which put to sea at sun-set with a fair wind, and were, at an early hour in the morning, at their place of debarkation. Here very little show of opposition was made. A few Boors, supported by a handful of French troops, rather watched our operations than strove to interrupt them; so that before dark we were all safely on shore, our piquets planted, and our bivouac formed. Yet were we not without our difficulties. The horses, unaccustomed to the sort of food laid in for them at St. Salvador, had fallen into such wretched condition, that they were incapable of doing service; and the guns it was necessary to drag by sheer manual labour
over the trackless sands of which the soil of this part of South Africa almost entirely consists. Accordingly, though we began our march next day, our progress was of necessity slow; while our sufferings from heat, and still more through the want of water, proved to be considerable. Still, as the enemy never showed a front, nor, indeed, approached nearer than a day’s march of us, we had, as a military body, nothing to do: and we found, on our arrival at Cape Town, that it was already in possession of the English.</p>
<p>The tale of the capture of the Cape of Good Hope has been so often told already, that I may he excused from entering upon the subject now, more especially as the operation presented but few incidents by the description of which a common reader or listener is likely to be attracted. A trifling skirmish opened the gates of the capital to
our people; after which General Jansen, unable to maintain himself in the interior, became, with his army, prisoners of war. Neither is it necessary to linger long over the details of my own life, during the few months which I spent in South Africa. One or two anecdotes, such as occur to my recollection at the moment, will probably suffice to fill up what might otherwise be a blank in my narrative; and then we pass on to other and more curious matters, in which it was my fortune to bear a part.</p>
<p>The duty in Cape Town resembled in almost every particular the order of service in a common garrison town in England. Sir David Baird, being a mighty disciplinarian, had all his infantry officers at the balance step ; and, watch in hand, appeared himself on the drill-ground, regulating their movements as if he had been the adjutant of a regiment. So passed the time from six to seven each morning, after which came regimental and brigade parades, from which the men never retired before nine, and sometimes not for an hour or two later. Meanwhile, in barracks, pipe-claying, heel-balling, and the other amusements peculiar to the soldier in those days, went forward; which were diversified by guard-mountings, field-days, roll-calls, and a system of drill, to which there seemed to be no end. It was otherwise with us of the 20th Light Dragoons. Our Colonel, Sir Robert Wilson, gave us as little trouble as possible. We took our piquets, to be sure, and paraded once a day, besides attending faithfully to our stable duty, and preserving good order; but he never harassed us with work that was not called for; and as to punishments, there were none, because they were not needed. Nay, more—he used to march us two or three times a week, in our stable-dresses, to an elevated plain about a mile from the town, and there encourage
us to play at all sorts of athletic games, himself and his brother officers taking part in them. This latter proceeding, however, accorded not at all with the rigid notions of the General. Having come upon us one day, while engaged in our sports, he took no notice of the circumstance at the moment, but the very next morning a general order appeared, which left us no leisure for a repetition
of the scene. The riding-school was brought into play—we had our parades and drills as well as the rest of them—and were made to feel that, under what is called a smart commander, the English soldier must cease to think of aught except the drudgery of his profession.</p>
<p>While the main body of our force occupied Cape Town, a line of outposts was established about seventy miles in the interior, which were relieved, from time to time, by detachments both of horse and foot, sent up for that purpose. It came to my turn, among others, to be employed on this service; and I found myself, with a captain of my own regiment, a cornet, a lieutenant of artillery, about forty men, and two six-pounders, occupying the house of a wealthy Dutch farmer. Our host was exceedingly civil, particularly to me,
who acted as interpreter between him and his guests; and being rich in flocks, and liberal in his ideas, we fared well. We had plenty to eat and drink, excellent stabling for our horses, little or nothing to do in the way of duty, and a good deal of amusement. For example, we all became hunters of wolves, of which we destroyed great numbers; though, at the outset, our acquaintance with these animals had well nigh proved too intimate. The case was this.</p>
<p>Our host was in the habit of collecting his flock every night, within a large kraal or pen, round which his slaves kept fires burning, in order to scare away the wolves. Not being aware of the boldness with which these animals make their attacks, I had gone, with a number of my comrades, to sleep one night among some straw, about fifty yards in front of the kraal; for the weather was hot,
the rooms were close, and we fancied that we should be more comfortable without doors than within. We made for ourselves excellent nests among the litter, which we drew over us, and were sound asleep, when suddenly a whole troop of animals came rushing along, numbers of which trod upon our chests, heads, and limbs, without, however, doing us any injury. We awoke, of course; and to our great astonishment, heard several shots fired, after which, back came our four-footed visitants, again dashing through our capacious bed without ceremony. This was too much, so we sprang to our feet, and learned, to our amazement, that the kraal had been attacked by a pack of wolves, a large portion of which had galloped over us as we lay asleep. Immediately an impulse was given, under which we acted during the remainder of our sojourn at the outposts. We watched for the wolves night after night, the artillery officer planting one of his guns so as to give them a salute—and once he fired, and, with the grape with which he had loaded, killed two of them. But the alarm throughout the line, occasioned by that shot, was indescribable. All night long patrols were coming into ascertain what was the matter; so that our officer was never again tempted to repeat his experiment, which, indeed, was little needed, for we soon found out a more convenient method of dealing with them. There were in our vicinity three wolf-towers—that is to say, circular buildings, hollow in the midst, and
about ten feet in height—having a sort of trap-door in each, similar in its construction to those which are used in rat-traps—and a place within where the bait, a rotten sheep, could be fastened. Into these the wolves were tempted every night, the trap-door falling down upon them the moment they touched a particular spring; and in the mornings we used to go, with muskets and carbines, to shoot
them from above. We destroyed by these means some hundreds of those mischievous animals.</p>
<p>Our tour of duty being ended we returned to Cape Town, where matters continued to be managed so as to disgust our commanding officer,
and to our great grief he left us. Before he went away, however, he assembled both officers and men upon parade, and assured us that his first proceeding after he should reach England, would be, to apply for our recall. He then entreated the major, on whom the command would devolve, to act up to the system of internal economy which he had established, and expressed a hope that when we met again, he should find the defaulter’s book as little blotted with entries as it was at that moment. Colonel Wilson was not yet out of sight of land, ere his parting admonition was forgotten. The officer to whose tender mercies he committed us had been educated in a different school, and he preferred the lessons learned in his youth to those which he had acquired in manhood; so the cat-o-nine-tails
which had fallen among us into entire disuse came immediately into play. I am quite sure that with all this severity the duty was not better done; and I know that things which used to be accounted an amusement, were now felt as a hardship.</p>
<p>Our only hope thenceforth was that Colonel Wilson would perform his promise, and that we should be recalled from a station which our superiors were determined to make as little agreeable to us as possible. Neither were we disappointed in that hope. The Colonel quitted us on Feb. 18, 1806, and in the month of August in the same year, there arrived two squadrons of the 21st Dragoons, to whom we were commanded to make over our horses. It was a bright day for us in which we obeyed that order, and our imaginations were busy with the delights of England, when a large black ship made her appearance in Table Bay, and our destination was immediately changed.</p>
<p>I had forgotten to state, that not long after the fall of the Cape, an expedition against Monte Video and Buenos Ayres was planned, and that a force under Brigadier General Beresford had proceeded with commodore Popham to attempt the reduction of these places. At first all went well with them. The enemy opened their gates, and the inhabitants submitted; but by-and-by a change for the worse occurred; and the vessel, just alluded to, was the bearer of dispatches which announced the imminent danger to which our comrades were exposed. Immediately reinforcements of ships and men were directed to proceed to the Plata; along with which we, being now dismounted, and one squadron of the 21st, to which our horses had been made over, received orders to take our passage.</p>
<p>Before I enter upon the narative of our operations on the river Plata, it is necessary that I should guard myself against the risk of being thought to speak in terms otherwise than respectful of Sir David Baird. He was undeniably too much addicted to the harassing system, and sometimes mistook the duties of an adjutant for those of a general: but he was impartial, paid no respect to persons, and never deprived the soldier of his dues. The treasure found at Cape Town, (and it was considerable) he divided on the spot between the fleet and the army; and he knew in dealing with individuals how to show mercy, as well as how to be severe. For example, there was one of his orderlies, a corporal of the 20th, who, though a good man on the whole, forgot himself so much as to get twice drunk, in spite of the general’s admonitions to the contrary. Now there was no crime which Sir David hated so much as drunkenness, out of which, he was accustomed to say, all other crimes took their rise; and corporal Marshall, after the second offence, was sent back to the regiment, with directions that he should be tried by a court-martial. The sentence implied, as might be expected, reduction to the ranks, to be followed by corporal punishment. The first of these punishments General Baird permitted our commanding officer to carry into execution ; from the last he desired that the culprit might be excused; and knowing his worth, he took him again into his family, where the man conducted himself ever after with the utmost propriety. He was accordingly restored to his chevrons, and I shall have occasion to speak of him again in the sequel.</p>
<p>I return now to our voyage, which proved to be tempestuous, insomuch that the fleet soon became scattered in all directions, and the ships were compelled to steer their course, each independently of its consorts. That in which the 20th light Dragoons happened to embark, was the first to reach the Plata,—a magnificent river, in point of width, and so soon as you ascend beyond the influence of the tide, remarkable for the excellence of its water. Of the scenery that adorns its banks—the wide and open plains bounded afar off by lofty mountains, it is unnecessary that I should speak. When you first enter the mighty stream you see, to be sure, nothing of these things, for the space from shore to shore measures upwards of one hundred miles, but as you draw towards Monte Video the panorama becomes attractive in the extreme, particularly to persons who, like ourselves, had suffered much from the effects of a rough sea. We were all therefore deeply interested with the objects around us, though our surprise was a good deal excited, when we found no vessel waiting with orders, nor other signs of our predecessors in the river. But at last a small King’s cutter hove in sight, which signalised us to come under her stern, and communicated to our captain the sad intelligence that General Beresford and his troops were
cut off. “I am sorry to say,” added the officer who spoke, “that we have not a foot of ground to stand upon; nevertheless you must continue your course till you reach the Admiral’s station, where directions will be given as to your future arrangements.”</p>
<p>On we went, grievously chagrined by a communication so little expected, till at the close of another day’s sail we beheld the fleet
lying at anchor in the middle of the river. Casting our eyes landward, we saw at the same time that the Spanish flag Waved upon the battlements of Monte Video, while an occasional shot from the batteries, as a boat or light craft ventured near, gave proof that the garrison was on the alert. As the commander of the cutter had forewarned us, we were immediately brought to by the admiral, who confirmed the intelligence of general Beresford’s defeat, and directed us to take up a convenient berth while our consorts were assembling. We obeyed his orders of course; and during several days our sole occupation consisted in watching the arrival of one straggler after another, and in speculating, as men so circumstanced are apt to do, touching the probable designs of our superiors.</p>
<p>The fleet came in at last, and no accident having occurred to any portion of it, was collected round the admiral’s ship in the order by him pointed out. Then followed signals for officers commanding regiments and the heads of departments to attend a council of war, the result of which was, that an attempt ought to be made, first to silence the enemy’s batteries which commanded the coast, and then to force a landing. As good luck would have it, too, there had arrived in the Plata a three-decker bound from India to England, which the admiral pronouncing unfit to undertake so long a voyage, added to his own squadron, and resolved to employ against the town. Accordingly she moved in support of a flotilla of schooners and ships’ launches towards Monte Video, in order to reduce which, several transports had at the same time been fitted up as bomb-ships. But there was not sufficient depth of water to bring the Lancaster within range; and the rest were too light to do damage to the enemy’s works. A couple of hours useless cannonading sufficed to show, that this scheme would not answer; and the battering vessels being recalled, new councils were held, and new determinations arrived at.</p>
<p>The senior officer present with our armament, was Lieutenant-Colonel Backhouse, of the 47th regiment; the second in command was Lieutenant-Colonel Vessel of the 38th. Colonel Brownrig acted as quarter-master-general, and was assisted in the adjutant-general’s department by Captain Ebrington. By these gentlemen—the whole staff of the army—it was judged expedient to get possession of Maldonado, an open town at some distance below Monte Video, where the troops being delivered from the inconveniences of a long imprisonment on board of ship, might establish a post, and wait for reinforcements. Accordingly at daybreak one morning the fleet weighed anchor; and keeping out of reach of the guns of a strong fort, which the enemy still held in the middle of the stream, brought up, after a few hours’ delay, as near to the bank as possible. Immediately the boats were hoisted out, and the troops having been already prepared for the movement, stepped without confusion into their places, and the disembarkation was effected. For there were no batteries here to harass us, and the ships’ launches with carronades in their bows, soon cleared the level strand of the few musketeers that showed themselves; yet were the enemy not unprepared to give us a welcome. About three or four hundred yards from high-water mark, there were some ranges of low sand-hills, behind which, having a couple of field-pieces to support them, the Spaniards were drawn up in force.—Though they did not see this formation, our chiefs suspected that such a thing might be, and they made their dispositions accordingly. The infantry was formed in an echellon line—the grenadiers of the 38th being near the right—the mounted cavalry were in
reserve—and we, who had no horses, fell in as light infantry on the left. Two three-pounders dragged by seamen constituted the whole
of our artillery, and considering the difficulties that attended the transport of wheel-carriages through the sand, they were amply sufficient for all purposes.</p>
<p>Such was the order into which we threw ourselves, as soon as the last of our detachments touched the land; and our advance was begun in the highest spirits, and in full confidence of success. Neither did the enemy fire a shot, till the grenadiers on our extreme right had topped the sand-hill, when a volley was thrown in upon them with more murderous effect than I recollect on any other occasion to have witnessed. They fell by sections—almost every man being struck in the head. There was, of course, a momentary confusion, while the survivors recoiled under the ridge, but no serious check occurred. The line formed again, sprang with a rush over the summit, poured in a well-directed fire upon the Spaniards, and overthrew them in a moment. No pause was made, nor time given to rally, for the squadron of the 21st charged home; and a round or two of grape from the three-pounders completed the defeat. We took the cannon and turned them on the fugitives—after which we pursued them into Maldonado, and sweeping from house to house, were in five minutes masters of the town. Then followed a scene of barricading and plunder, such as I have no words to describe. While some ran to fill up the ends of the streets with barrels, cars, and household furniture, others broke into wine and spirit stores, or ranged through the dwellings of the
inhabitants, carrying destruction and terror into all their quarters. For our commandant gave his people three hours’ licence, and never surely did men make better use of the opportunities afforded them. It was in vain that the officers flew from cellar to cellar, knocking in the heads of casks and pouring out the contents into the street. The soldiers, if they could not get at liquor elsewhere, dropped their canteens into the kennel and were soon in a state which set all subordination and discipline at defiance. It was well for lis that the Spaniards did not think of returning to the attack. If they had done so, we should have been cut to pieces, almost without resistance.</p>
<p>Maldonado, though not a fortified town, was a military station—that is to say, there was a barrack there—a gloomy pile, having all its windows secured with iron bars and surrounded by a lofty wall. Into that building we thrust our prisoners, of whom a large number had fallen into our hands, and there kept them till an opportunity offered of sending them on board the fleet. Meanwhile the few among our own people who were fit for duty, took the outposts, and the rest slept where they had fallen down—some in houses, some in the streets, but all in a state of helpless intoxication. Under such circumstances, the night was, to those in command, an anxious one. But with the morrow came such threats from head-quarters, as, assisted by the provost and his guard, restored order; and the men betook themselves to the work of fortifying and rendering the post tenable. Moreover, the walls of the houses were posted with proclamations inviting the inhabitants to return home, and assuring them, in the common style of such documents, that the English were not come as
conquerors but as friends. Still the work of pillage, though covertly carried on, could not be entirely suppressed ; and I plead guilty in my own person, of having committed one outrage upon property.</p>
<p>I have no taste for drinking, and never had. Like other soldiers I enjoyed my glass when it came in the way; but such scenes as were
enacted in Maldonado on the present occasion always filled me with horror and disgust. While others were marauding in crowds I accordingly kept quiet; but no sooner was discipline restored than I determined to see whether the wholesale plunderers had left any gleanings behind, such as might satisfy my moderate desires. With this view I sallied forth one day from the barrack, into which we were by this time marched, and stealing along by the backs of the houses so as to elude the notice of the provost, I entered a deserted mansion, and began to look about. It was thoroughly ransacked, the furniture was all broken, and every thing of value apparently removed; indeed I saw but one article on the ground floor, a small square table which was entire. I struck my fist upon it, and heard
something rattle. This induced me to feel about for the handle of some drawer; but I could discover nothing of the kind, so I turned it
upside down, and jumped upon it. The bottom of the drawer gave way, and I beheld a dozen silver-handled knives and forks, of which I took immediate possession, and wrapping them up in my pocket-handkerchief, stuffed them into my bosom, and mounted the stairs. Again, the spectacle that met my eyes was of the most melancholy kind, for the progress of the spoiler was everywhere visible; yet I again ascertained that my predecessors had left their work incomplete, and my hopes were a second time excited. There was a small door in the wall of one of the bed-rooms which seemed to have escaped notice, for it was closed, and resisted all my efforts to open it. “Now,” thought I, “suppose the Padrone should have kept his money-chest here. It is exactly the sort of place for a safe”—and money and jewels, it may be necessary to add, were the only species of property which I coveted. Full of this idea I looked about till I discovered a shovel in one of the cellars, with which I attacked the door, now pressing it from below, now forcing my weapon through the
narrow side slit, till at last it flew open. I sprang forward and found myself in a well-furnished dressing closet—in the wardrobes surrounding which were both ladies’ and gentlemen’s apparel, made after the newest fashion, and of the most costly materials. But I did not want coats or silk gowns, so I looked farther and beheld two trunks, both of them locked, standing at the opposite extremity. Into them, with the help of my friendly shovel, I soon made my way, and was again disappointed to perceive that they, too, were filled with articles of dress. Shirts of the finest linen, chemises flounced with lace, silk stockings, silk handkerchiefs, and ladies’ shoes—these made up the lading of the boxes—while here and there I came upon a petticoat of the richest brocade, and a robe of which I could scarce estimate the value.</p>
<p>I gazed long and eagerly on my treasure, lamenting only the absence of means for securing it entire; and pondering within myself what selection to make out of so much that was tempting. At last, after packing up a petticoat or two, I found them too bulky, and was forced to content myself with a dozen shirts, as many shifts, some silk stockings and handkerchiefs. Of these I made a bundle, with which, under my arm, I loitered about till it grew dark, and then stole quietly back, throwing all my eyes about me, to the barrack. I was fortunate enough to reach my quarters unobserved, and soon won the hearts of the women of the regiment, by distributing among them the chemises and silk stockings. The shirts and handkerchiefs I of course kept to myself, and for many years afterwards I continued to wear them, whenever it was my wish to appear in female society to the best advantage.</p>
