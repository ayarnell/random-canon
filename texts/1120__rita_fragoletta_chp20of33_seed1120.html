<p>How I have neglected my journal of late!
<p>I had made up my mind to keep a regular account of all that happened at Wyefield, but since I took up my painting again, I have not done so. I have always determined to put down a faithful record of my thoughts and feelings, and yet I shrink from doing so now. I knew that it was something more than a girlish fancy, this regard for Colonel Rayburne, and now I have learnt that he is no longer free, and that to worship him in secret, as I have so long done, is a sin, forbidden by that code of worldly morality which treats human hearts as machines that can be made to love and unlove at order.</p>
<p>“Was it all my fault too?” I asked myself this question, looking back with clearer eyes on those past days that his presence had made so sweet and glorious. I asked it, remembering how he had lingered by my side in noons and nights, and listened to my singing, and talked to me, by plainly-shown preference, in that half-cynical half-teasing fashion I had grown to care for so dearly.</p>
<p>Need all love be written and spoken any more than the poems which a beautiful thought embodies, or a beautiful
scene inspires? We feel the meaning of both—we need no words to explain it. And so, it seems to me, that there is
more eloquence often in a look, a smile, a touch, than in a million words.</p>
<p>Many such looks of his had set my heart beating wildly, had filled me with a soft, strange trouble; had made me
think, “It cannot be that I am quite a child in his eyes.”</p>
<p>And, after all, he had gone away, only bidding me not forget him. As if, indeed, that were possible! There are people who spend a lifetime together, and yet never catch sight, for one single moment, of each other’s souls; there are others, again, who by some subtle intuition can at once read and understand that inner nature which is, after all, the best part of ourselves—the one thing that makes even the sceptical believe a little in the mystery of the soul.</p>
<p>And I had caught many such glimpses, and I knew that he was noble, and earnest, and brave of heart, and that even though I loved him unasked, it was a love that would do him no harm, nor even make me feel ashamed.</p>
<p>But now—</p>
<p>Ah! it was all altered now. I had come up for the season with Clarice to London. Her sister was to be married, and they wished me to be one of the bridesmaids. And it was after the wedding (a month ago now) that I heard the news that has crushed out all the warm springing hopes of my heart. For he is wedded. My hero he may still be—my
ideal of all that is noble, and brave, and true in man; but—nothing more. I did not think it was in me to feel as I felt when first those words reached my ears, spoken by his friend. I seemed to feel broken, old, stupefied. The sunshine of my life turned to darkness. I tried to grasp at the truth, to feel the pity and the scorn for my own weakness that I ought to have felt, and yet—and yet—</p>
<p>They say I fainted. I know I woke feeling dazed and bewildered still; and then I saw Clarice’s pitiful face, and in her eyes I read that she too knew my secret; and the shame, and the sorrow, and the misery of it all seemed to overcome me, and I cried as if my heart would break.</p>
<p>She went away and left me to my solitude and my grief, and I think those bitter, passionate tears did me good. I
grew calmer at last. I remembered the story I had heard, and I saw in it but a fresh proof of the chivalrous nature
of the man I loved.</p>
<p>For why should I conceal it? I did love him. I do love him; and I do not think I shall be any the worse woman for that fact, or need be classed amongst the sinning, because I can look it calmly in the face without false reasoning.</p>
<p>We cannot love because we are loved any more than we can prevent love from visiting our hearts, whether we will or no. It steals upon us unawares, and only when we are bound hand and foot do we perceive how complete and absolute a bondage is ours. The wisest and weakest must submit alike. The passion is there; with each heart alone rests the power to ennoble or debase it.</p>
<p>And, sad to say, in the records of human lives it is often the least worthy who is loved best, the falsest who receive the truest fidelity.</p>
<p>For, indeed, in the world there are so many things wrong and crooked, that the greatest and wisest of humanity can do but little to set it straight, even though they spend their lives, their means’, their strength, in such unprofitable service.</p>
<p>Well, I have been fighting my battle for a month now, and I do not think even my tender-hearted Clarice quite
knows how hard a one it has been.</p>
<p>But gradually youth and strength have asserted themselves. The interests, the occupations, the sorrows of a great city were new to me, and to none of them could I shut my eyes or ears, or even my aching heart.</p>
<p>But it was the poor for whom I felt so much. The poor in London, who have not the picturesqueness, the simple tastes and pleasures of those in my native land—who are shut out from the sun and air, and throng the dingy alleys, and narrow close streets, and seem to know life but for the sake of death, and live on in squalid stagnant misery, from the year’s beginning to its end.</p>
<p>And the little children—the poor, white-faced, wretched little children. Oh, how my heart bled for them! and yet how little one could do to make them happy for even a little while. Money! Ah, but it goes such a little way, and I have seen the drunken father snatch it from the weak young hands, and hasten away to spend it among those as low and degraded as himself.</p>
<p>It was all so dreadful, so hopeless. It was that very hopelessness often that overcame me; that made my hot young heart rebel against the cruel injustice—the fearful wrongs that humanity suffers.</p>
<p>“How can Heaven let such things be !” I said passionately to Caryl Brooklyn, who was often my companion on some
errand of charity.</p>
<p>He sighed. “You are not the first by many who has asked that question,” he said; “nor am I the last who will fail to answer it.”</p>
<p>And as the spring grew brighter and fairer, and the buds peeped shyly forth, and the warm sunshine lay on the parks and squares, and even the murky, ugly city looked fresh and gay to my eyes, I thought more and more of the thousands to whom it brought no pleasure and no hope—who had to live and breathe, and endure existence as best they could—who might long for green fields and daisied meadows till their hearts ached with longing, and yet saw but dusty streets and choked lanes, and the tawdry frightfulness or barren desolation of their homesteads, and heard but coarse voices and fierce oaths, and saw the blue heavens afar off through packed and crowded roofs; nor smelt the scent of flowers and clean fresh earth from the beginning to the end of life.</p>
<p>And one could do so little to help it; so miserably, pitifully little! Is it any wonder that my own sorrow grew small in comparison with the vastness of one that stretched itself like a funeral pall over all the width and length of one of earth’s great cities—one only of all the many that men have built and sin has cursed!</p>
<p>I know the problem has puzzled wiser heads than mine. I suppose it will so puzzle and distress them till the end of time; but does that make it any the less painful for each one who compassionates and would fain help the misery that reigns on every side, and yet feels that each effort is but as a grain of sand that is laid for the foundation of a mountain!</p>
<p>“If your picture is sold, what will you do with the money?” asked Clarice of me one day, when my visit was
drawing to a close.</p>
<p>“I will give it to the poor,” I answered.</p>
<p>“What a little Doña Quixote you are!” she said, looking at me in wonder. “Why, my dear, if you spent thousands
of pounds on them to-day they would be as badly off to-morrow.”</p>
<p>“I know,” I said hopelessly; “but still if one can make even two or three happier for ever such a little while, it is something.”</p>
<p>“You have done a great deal of good, I think,” she resumed presently, “more in these two months than I have even thought of in the whole course of my life. You have found work for women, employment for girls, made clothes for children. I can’t think how you can manage it.”</p>
<p>“If I could only do more!” It was always my cry; it all looked so hopeless now, and I was soon going away, and the few who knew me would forget me; and the old grinding cares would fall upon them, perhaps, and their promises
would no longer be remembered, and the drunkenness and disorder would be resumed. Yes, it was hard; and yet the
more I felt the hardness and the difficulties, the more I longed to combat them.</p>

<p>I had almost forgotten my picture when, one morning, I received a notice to say it was accepted for the Academy
Exhibition. I had called it “Riding down to Camelot,” but the subject treated little of the story of the Lady of Shalott. There was the figure of Sir Launcelot on his steed—the sunlight flashing on his noble face and on the blue river winding by that silent isle where dwelt the mysterious lady on whom, for his sake, the curse fell. Her pale face and wondering eyes looked out from the window—(the face of Clarice, altered to suit my fancy of the fated inmate of “many-towered Camelot”). But the knight, with his brave, bright eyes and smile like sunlight, had in the picture that same face which haunted my waking hours.</p>
<p>I had not meant to make the likeness more than just a faint one, but insensibly it had grown beneath my fingers even as its memory lived in my heart, and Clarice had almost started when she saw it.</p>
<p>“Colonel Rayburne!” she exclaimed. “Why, what a
capital likeness!”
<p>“Is it so very like ?” I asked anxiously. “Oh, Clarice, I hope not. I did not want it to bear more than a shadowy resemblance—just as your own does.”</p>
<p>“It is like enough, for anyone who has known him, to recognise him again,” she said, laughing. “But don’t look
so troubled, my dear, he will only take it as a great compliment.”</p>
<p>I altered it a little, but I dared not do much for fear of spoiling the picture. And I asked Caryl Brooklyn to come and see it, anxious to know what he had to say.</p>
<p>He stood before the picture for a long time quite silent. Then suddenly he turned to me, his face very pale.</p>
<p>“He was with you that day in the woods,” he said, pointing to my knight.</p>
<p>“I had no model,” I said, colouring. “And, you see, I was obliged to draw from some type of face.”</p>
<p>“You could not have chosen a nobler,” he answered with a faint sigh.</p>
<p>And in my heart I echoed the acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Ah me! that all seems long ago now, and we have seen Sir Launcelot on the Academy walls many times, and the
critics have praised it more warmly than it deserved; and my head might well have been turned by all the flattery and commendation I have received, only that my heart is so sore within me; and as I look at my Sir Launcelot I know he is mine no longer “but another’s.” And now as if to complete my success, I have been offered a millionaire’s cheque for it, and the noble offer came from no less a personage than Mr. Burton, of Fontayne Abbey.</p>
<p>“Shall you accept it?” asked Clarice, in wonder at the coincidence.</p>
<p>I thought of my poor—of the few whose misery I had tried to lighten, whose wants this money would supply for
many months.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said; and when I saw the gladness and gratitude that the money brought to many a poor and suffering
creature, I felt glad that, unconsciously to himself, the purse-proud millionaire had done some good.</p>
<p>And so those days, when my sorrow and I first became acquainted with each other, were not such cold and hopeless
days as they might have been, and I did not isolate myself from the joys and pleasures of life because I partook of them with an aching heart and a memory that stabbed me with ever-constant pain.</p>
<p>When one is young, and has health and strength, and can rejoice in the beauty of earth, and read the poetry of nature, it is hard to believe that a living death has fallen on the soul because the days bring only the remembrance of past hopes and the years to come we shrink from thinking of. I did not deceive myself. I did not attempt to let my heart dwell on future joys—on some chain of happy circumstance that might even now unite the broken links of our sundered lives. No, I put my dreams aside, tenderly, sorrowfully, as a mother puts by the little shoe or the tiny garment of the child she has buried. Suffering had taught me a lesson hard and painful to bear, but, thank Heaven, it had not robbed me of all faith and love—it had only made me more humble, and filled me with an infinite yearning for the sorrows and woes of others.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the season had run on its course, and my life had been full of gaiety, and Clarice was so happy, it did one’s heart good to look at her bright face. But in no pleasures or excitement did I ever find forgetfulness, and in no face or voice did there live the charm that that face of my knight, Sir Launcelot, had worn for me in my brief summer’s dream.</p>
<p>“Can one be faithful to a memory only?” Clarice had said to me once.</p>
<p>And as I stood, and looked into my own heart, I told her, “Yes.”</p>
<p>She laughed. She did not believe me; but then, all women are not alike; and, no doubt, to her I seemed a foolish child, to whom dreams are enough and before whom the world lies untrodden and unknown.</p>
