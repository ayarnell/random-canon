<p>Mrs. Crewe and Denzil were sitting in the dining-room with both windows open, for the latter was indulging in a cigar as he read, and his mother was busy arranging her letters, a very confused pile of ragged papers, making many comments for her son's information, to which he occasionally replied by inarticulate utterances that nevertheless quite contented her.</p>
<p>'You are early, my dear,' said Mrs. Crewe, as Laura entered. 'I did not expect you for an hour yet.'</p>
<p>'Winnie was tired, so we came away a little sooner than the rest,' said Laura, throwing aside her cloak and standing by the table in her long black silk dress, which, with her white lace fichu and ruffle, suited her unusually well.</p>
<p>Her gentle dignity of bearing struck Mrs. Crewe. She felt, as most did who knew Laura, that there was something in her to trust and lean upon, an inner light and force which, though not easy to define, would never fail or mislead. Thinking thus, Mrs. Crewe did not speak
immediately, and, looking from mother to son, Laura said with a smile:</p>
<p>'How happy you seem, sitting comfortably together. Your mother is quite ten years younger since you settled down at home, Denzil.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' he returned, a soft gratified look stealing over his face, and a slight increase of colour, perhaps at Laura's unconscious use of his Christian name, perhaps because he knew that his mother's halcyon days would not last long.</p>
<p>'We are all the happier now you have joined us,' said Mrs. Crewe, holding out her hand to Laura. 'You are looking uncommonly well, my dear. You have quite a colour; hasn't she, Denzil?'</p>
<p>'Of course I have, if you notice it,' returned Laura, laughing and blushing vividly.</p>
<p>'Well, dear, and what had you for dinner?' began Mrs. Crewe, hastily tying up a parcel of selected letters, and tearing up the refuse with much energy.</p>
<p>Laura replied to the best of her ability, but acknowledged that many items escaped her memory.</p>
<p>'You should always try to notice and remember dishes,' said Mrs. Crewe gravely. 'The ideas they suggest will be of use to you when you have a house of your own, and give dinner-parties.'</p>
<p>Laura laughed. 'Could you fancy me giving dinner-parties? All that sort of society seems quite out of my reach; my world will never stretch beyond a studio and a few friends.'</p>
<p>'What did Mrs. Piers wear? I mean the Dowager,' resumed Mrs. Crewe, and a severe examination as to the toilettes of the company ensued. Then, after a slight break in the dialogue, Mrs. Crewe remarked: 'I suppose young Mr. Piers still seems very attentive and taken up with his wife?'</p>
<p>'Yes, of course! Why do you ask?' cried Laura, with a slight start; the question jarred strangely upon her. Could Mrs. Crewe divine that there was any reverse to the bright picture of their lives?</p>
<p>'Oh! I have no particular reason; only it strikes me that Reginald Piers will not be the most constant man in the world. He was very nice and pleasant, but I always thought him unsteady. I do hope she will know how to manage him.'</p>
<p>'Come, come, mother !' cried Denzil, smiling. 'You are an awful Cassandra sometimes.'</p>
<p>'I am nothing of the kind, Denzil; and even in joke, my dear boy, you should not call your mother names; these nautical allusions are quite beyond my comprehension.'</p>
<p>'I beg your pardon, mother,' quite gravely.</p>
<p>'Is it necessary to manage?' asked Laura, 'Surely with truth and tenderness one might keep a straight course.'</p>
<p>'And win the goal,' said Denzil, in a low tone.</p>
<p>'I am not so sure,' exclaimed Mrs. Crewe. 'You see, one can never know what a man thinks. It takes two to make truth of any use--one to speak and another to hear it; and most men are vexed when a woman is true and reasonable. It does not amuse them.'</p>
<p>'I protest, mother, you are ferociously severe. Why, I flattered myself you were fond of your son's sex.'</p>
<p>'So I am,' she returned eagerly. 'I always like to have men about me--they can be very kind and useful; but the best of them require management; they like it, too--so much the better for us.'</p>
<p>'You must not let your son too much behind the scenes,' said Laura.</p>
<p>'Oh, Denzil is different from other men,' cried his mother. 'Do you know, he has been making such a delightful plan; I hope you will agree to it. There is a cottage belonging to a friend of his to be let for two months, down somewhere on--on what coast, Denzil?'</p>
<p>'Dorsetshire.'</p>
<p>'Yes, Dorsetshire. It seems that his friend wants to take his little girl away to London for medical advice, or some operation to be performed, so Denzil proposes that we exchange houses. You and I and the Admiral (if we can persuade him) will go down there the week after next, and Denzil will come down when he can, from Saturday till Monday. Think of the fresh air, and the sea-beach, and the wild flowers, the eggs and the milk, the cliffs, and cheap fish. When can you manage to start, my dear Laura?'</p>
<p>'It would be very delicious,' exclaimed Laura immediately, seeing refreshing visions of blue waves and changing cloud shadows; 'but I must arrange so much, and oh! I cannot go while Winnie and Reginald are here.'</p>
<p>Her face changed as she spoke, and the dread of Winnie's promised disclosures came like a gray mist wreath wrapping her heart in a chilling vapour and chasing the colour from her cheek. Denzil looked sternly at her as she spoke, but she did not heed him.</p>
<p>'It is growing late,' he said abruptly; 'we must not keep Miss Piers up. I shall wish you good-night. You can discuss the question of Barton's cottage to-morrow. He wants to come up here the first week in August.'</p>
<p>So saying, he rose, kissed his mother's brow in passing, and, wishing Laura good-night, left the room.</p>
<p>'Dear me ! how very sudden Denzil is sometimes,' said Mrs. Crewe. 'That is the misfortune of not having been in 'the Service.' Nice and good as he is, he cannot help a certain amount of the <em>je ne sais quoi</em> which men in the Mercantile Marine contract.'</p>
<p>'I am sure,' cried Laura heartily, 'there are Royal Navy sailors not comparable to Denzil in manner, or, indeed, in
any way.'</p>
<p>'You are a dear, kind, discriminating girl. But just think what a chance this is of going out of town, my love,
without a shilling of expense beyond the railway fares--and at this season we can get excursion tickets. Indeed, I expect to make a considerable saving, for of course milk, butter, eggs, vegetables, and butcher's meat will be considerably cheaper than here. I believe there is a vegetable and fruit garden, and a boat; we might fish for ourselves. Collins will remain here, and I wish them joy of her! She
behaved shamefully to-day, and sent up the new potatoes perfectly raw.'</p>

<p>After careful consideration, Laura decided not to mention Winnie's intended visit to Mrs. Crewe, but trust to the chapter, of accidents to secure them an uninterrupted <em>tête-à-tête</em>, and accident befriended her.</p>
<p>When Laura returned flushed and eager, almost fearing she was late, she found the coast clear, and had hardly divested herself of her outdoor attire when Winifrid arrived. She was looking very pale, and her eyes had a pained, fixed expression.</p>
<p>'How nice to find you all alone, dear Laura, Since I made up my mind to tell you everything, I have been thirsting to begin,' she cried, as she embraced her cousin.</p>
<p>'Mrs. Crewe is out for the whole afternoon. I think we may stay in the drawing-room.'</p>
<p>'Oh no, no!' said Winifrid feverishly, 'I can only tell all I have to tell in your own room, with the door locked.
To think that I am but fifteen months a wife, and have such fears, such doubts! Is it not cruel?'</p>
<p>'Come, then, dear,' was Laura's only answer, and they ascended to her chamber.</p>
<p>'I must begin a long way back—a long, long way back,' said Winifrid, drawing off her gloves and removing her bonnet in an absent, hurried way.</p>
<p>'Tell me,' asked Laura, as she paused, 'was Reginald very, very angry?'</p>
<p>'No, I have scarcely seen him since. He was late, and this morning he was odd and cold, and a little contemptuous. He asked how I was, and when I tried to tell him that he did not know how I had been provoked, he laughed, and said, "I daresay Madame Moscynska could manage a dozen of you! When you are more a woman of the world, you will not make so much ado about nothing. However, you must smooth down my mother the best way you can," and then he went out. I am more distressed when he is like that than by his anger.'</p>
<p>'Now tell me everything,' said Laura.</p>
<p>'When we first went to Paris,' began Winnie abruptly, and then broke off to exclaim, with a quiver in her voice, 'Oh! what a happy, happy time it was! When I look back to those days I feel how great is the change that has come over our life. And we might still be so happy if only--yes--in those days I was selfish in my enjoyment, I scarcely ever thought of you; and if I did, I put it away, because it was so painful to remember that my gain was your loss. Well, when we arrived in Paris, Madame Moscynska called immediately. I had heard Reginald speak of her, and I was quite pleased to know any friend of his. I thought her charming. She used to put me in such goodhumour with myself, and she used to discuss what dresses would suit me with Reginald, as if she were a loving elder sister. Then, in some way I cannot describe, a little cloud came between us. I grew frightened at the costly things she wanted me to choose, and would not be persuaded to have them, and sometimes Reginald sided with me. Then I used to feel a little left out when they talked for hours of their adventures in that yacht, though I was ashamed of myself, and tried to seem interested. Then we went away, and did the Italian lakes. Ah! how delightful that was,
until poor Reggie was ill at Florence. He has never been quite--quite the same since. We came straight back to Paris, and found the Princess just arrived. She was very kind and helpful, and certainly managed to amuse Reginald wonderfully. She dined with us every day, and then she wanted still to buy everything for me, but I resisted. I was not cross—indeed I was not; I only said I must learn to act for myself.'</p>
<p>'Well?'asked Laura, as she paused; 'an indefinable estrangement had grown up between you?'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes; I am dwelling too long on this time. One evening we were sitting after dinner, and they were talking
of their travels. The Princess had just said, "You remember that night we lay off Istria?" when I turned to find a needle, and caught a look from her to my husband, a look I cannot describe; it haunted me, but not for long. Reginald, who was very changeable, was so good, so tender, so taken up with me, that I put away my doubts, yet I never felt quite the same again to Madame Moscynska. Then we came to England. She happened to be coming too, and gradually I began to feel that she was like an evil spirit, bringing misfortune to me. I cannot describe how she pervaded everything, how she charmed every one. Mrs. Piers was fascinated by her. But for a long time Reginald did not mind her much. She used to spend two or three days with us now and then, but she was chiefly at her uncle's, Lord Dereham's, and we met at all the dinners and parties; and as certain as we met, she did or said something that made me look awkward or <em>bête</em>. It is impossible to tell you the effect she produced upon me. One day I dared to open my heart to Reggie, and told him how she affected me. He was not cross or unkind, but he laughed and kissed me, and exclaimed, "Jealous already, Winnie? If you take that view of our friend there is no use talking
reason to you." Then I felt I was fighting the air, and all the time the air was poisoning me. I tried to think myself foolish, morbid. Oh, the pain, the struggle of that time! And Mrs. Piers openly sided with Madame Moscynska, and in a covert way rebuked me for my bad temper and jealousy. Then Reginald began to have a way of looking round as if he wanted somebody when he came into a room, even at home. But in April last we had gone to a great dinner at Dairysford, and I noticed that Reginald nearly cut the Princess. There was a Polish cousin of
hers there, Graf somebody, a very handsome, wicked-looking man. He and the Princess were always talking together. After that Mrs. Piers had gone back to town, and Madame Moscynska was talking of going to Poland--she was always hinting at plots and politics; but Reginald was
very kind, and stayed much with me.</p>
<p>'One afternoon I had gone into his dressing-room to put a new pair of braces I had worked for him on his table. It was very untidy, papers and things scattered about. His man had not been in to arrange it, so I began mechanically to put it right. I gathered up the letters, most of them on business, and went to put them into a little box or case that closed with a spring and stood on his table. The key was out, but evidently had not been turned, for when I touched the spring it flew open, and on the top lay an open note. It had no address, but I knew the writing, and I remember every word of it.'</p>
<p>'Can you repeat it?' asked Laura, deeply, painfully interested.</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Winifrid slowly, with a look as though reading something at a great distance. It was this: "You were wrong to doubt; circumstances have been very hard for me; nevertheless I will give you the assurance you demand,--more, I promise all you wish in future, provided--," then a long dash. "I have struggled with an untoward destiny all my life; must it overtake me now? I shall be in town on the 25th, when I can see you safely. You have cruelly misjudged me. If only you will hear me, all may be as it was before, when there was yet hope for us both. Let me see you as usual on Wednesday.--Ever yours, H." I knew the H was for Hedwig. When I read this everything seemed to stand out before me in clear blazing light. "Before" meant before he married me. I was the obstacle, and by some means I was to be
effaced. What was life to me without Reginald and love? And I was so young.'</p>
<p>She covered up her face as if she could not bear the memory of that terrible moment.</p>
<p>'I did not feel angry with Reginald,' she resumed. 'I felt sorry for him. I think I lost my senses for a moment; then I remembered it was Wednesday. I shut up the box, put the note in my pocket, went back to my own sitting-room, rang the bell, and said I wished to see my husband when he came in. I did not know what I was going to do or to say. I was desperate, determined to know what I had to
dread, what to renounce, before another day had gone over my head.'</p>
<p>She stopped for a moment; her breath came quickly; she seemed parched and fevered. Laura rose to bring her a glass of water. Winnie drank it eagerly and recommenced:</p>
<p>'I do not know how I lived through the time till Reginald came back, and I could not tell if it were an hour or a lifetime before I saw him come into the room. I only know I ran to him, for, as I said, I did not feel angry with him, but wildly frightened, and burning to free him and myself from some evil spell. I could not believe he preferred any one on earth but ma I ran to him, and cried, "Oh, Reggie dear! what is this 1 What can it mean?" holding up the note before him. Oh, Laura! I shall never forget his face. He looked at me so that I shrank away. He grew red, and then hissed out, "Where did you find this?" snatching it from me.</p>
<p>'" In your despatch-box," I said. "I went to put away some letters that were lying about, and I found Madame Moscynska's note open."</p>
<p>'" How dare you pry into my private papers? By heaven, she will think I have betrayed her!" and he began to pace up and down furiously, tearing the note into a dozen fragments. I was stunned. Not a word to soothe me; not a syllable of explanation; his only thought appeared to be of her. At last he exclaimed, "Have you talked to any one else of your insane suspicions?" Then my head seemed to give way, and I just remember holding out my arms to him and crying, "They are foolish and insane, are they not? No, no, I would not say a word of them to any one but you, and you will put them all away out of my head." He turned to me with a changed expression, and then I think he caught me as I was falling, and I can remember nothing more till I came to myself in mortal agony, and Reginald was beside me and the doctor, and
I thought I was dying. It was not death, however, but a new life that came to me.'</p>
<p>Again she stopped, and a few tears relieved her.</p>
<p>'I was very, very ill; I scarcely cared to live; only as the days went by, and I saw Reginald constantly near me, so kind and anxious and tender, I began to hope and to revive, and then I recovered slowly. I could not put any questions to Reginald, but I used to look at him, I know, with my soul in my eyes; and one day, almost the first I was able to sit up, he said, "Now you are stronger, I want to explain all that stupid affair of Madame Moscynska's note." And I, with my hand in his, listened, glad to believe anything rather than break the delicious calm of that moment of repose. He said the truth was, Madame Moscynska had asked him for a loan of money some time before; that he had hesitated to give it because he thought it was to help her cousin, who was a scamp. The Princess was deeply offended, and did not speak to him for several days; then she looked so miserable that he sent her a little line to say he was willing to oblige her. The note I found was an answer to this, and as it was difficult to find an opportunity for private conversation at Dairysford, and my jealousy cut her off from Pierslynn, she was obliged to make a rendezvous in the grounds; and then he tried to remember the words of the letter. He explained it all as bearing on this loan. The "hope for both of us," he said, meant for herself and her cousin, both of whom were much embarrassed. The "seeing him safely in London" was safe from the interference of Lord Dereham, as Madame Moscynska was always afraid of her uncle knowing the state of her affairs.'</p>
<p>'Was that not a very natural explanation?' asked Laura thoughtfully.</p>
<p>'It seemed so to me,' said Winifrid. 'I was too glad to believe it then, only Reginald said nothing explanatory about seeing him as usual on Wednesday, and I would not be so exacting as to allude to it. But I was glad to be quiet and to believe. He was so dear and kind. Ah!
he loved me—he still loves me! I have not lost him yet! I began, in my returned happiness, to believe I had been unjust to the Princess. Reginald told me she was going away on a long visit to some relations in Poland, and that he wished me very much to receive her before she left. I consented; I was so glad she was going.</p>
<p>'She came, more softly calm, more soothingly pliable, than ever. Yet, as before, I felt instinctively that she deliberately set herself to cross and neutralise me. After she had looked tenderly and thoughtfully at the baby, as if divining his future (I know she detested infants), and talking of the interest every one took in me, she said, gently raising those strange eyes of hers to mine, "Before
I go I must confess my sins to you, dear Mrs. Piers, and tell you how generous and kind your husband has been." So she went on to say that both her cousin and herself had got into difficulty in consequence of being mixed up in some political schemes; that at the present moment
they were greatly embarrassed, and she had ventured to ask Reginald for help, which he had kindly accorded. I said I was glad he could be of use, and then added, "He has, I see, told you that your note on that subject fell into my hands, and probably that I misinterpreted it? I was foolish, perhaps, but you should not write so ambiguously."</p>
<p>'She looked surprised, and paused a little before she replied: "Have you not always misinterpreted me? I have felt it deeply. Nevertheless, I shall not offend again; I am on the point of returning to my own dear unhappy land for a long sojourn." Then my mother-in-law came in, and they talked till they tired me, and I had great difficulty in getting composed after she had gone, so much had her "confession" disturbed me.</p>
<p>'Though I blushed for my own suspiciousness, I was always wondering if they had arranged what she should say between them. I was not so well after this, and then I began to yearn for you. I had a sudden bitter conviction that nothing and no one was quite true and real but
you. I think so still, dear, dear Laura!'</p>
<p>A sudden choking sob stopped her utterance for a moment.</p>
<p>'At any rate,' she resumed, 'Madame Moscynska went away and I began to forget her. Reginald was so good; and though I knew Mrs. Piers thought me jealous, she was kind enough, so I began to dream of happiness again--and yet the same complete love and trust I once had
never quite came back. There were looks and tones of Reginald's that in some way always set me doubting.'</p>
<p>'I fear you tormented yourself ingeniously,' said Laura, with a sigh.</p>
<p>'I tried hard not,' returned Winnie; 'but I felt more exacting, less even-tempered than I used to be. Then you came. That did me a world of good; and Reginald was more at ease with you. And it was so nice when Mrs. Piers went, even when Reginald went, until one morning--do you remember?--you mentioned accidentally that Madame Moscynska had not gone abroad. It gave me a great shock. However, Reginald came back so soon, and everything looked so fair, that I did not disturb myself much till I came up to town and found that dreadful woman here; found that she had laid her plans, that she had got every one on her side, and that she was resolved to force herself on me. Laura, I do not know
what witchery there is about her; but I fear as much as I hate her, and I strive to deliver my husband from her, as much for his sake as my own. But, ah! he is slipping from me. The moment she appears there is a subtle change in him. Yet, Laura, I do not, will not despair.
If only I had Reginald to myself all might yet be well; but, dearest, you must never let her win you over; never let her persuade you that she is a well-intentioned woman, not quite stiff enough for English ideas, and that I am jealous.'</p>
<p>'She shall never do that!' cried Laura warmly. 'I have always had an instinctive distrust of her; yet, dear Winnie, I do think you have tormented yourself unnecessarily. Things will mend.'</p>
<p>'Not if I am off my guard. She shall never display herself to the world as my intimate friend; and yet I almost tremble to think how she nearly defied me last night; that showed she felt pretty sure of her ground. And she is going down again to Dairysford, Laura, where
I cannot escape her without a fracas! I mean to get Dr. Prior to order me to Carlsbad or somewhere, and once away, I shall feel safe; Reginald cannot refuse to come with me.'</p>
<p>'Yes, perhaps that would be well,' returned Laura, and fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>How should she add to Winnie's burden by disclosing the facts which had lately come to her knowledge? Yet might not the assertion of her claim rouse Reginald to a sense of duty? They surely might arrange between them so that he need not be impoverished, and yet that her
rights should be acknowledged.</p>
<p>While she thought, Winnie rose and looked at her watch. 'Dear Laura, I have been talking to you for more than an hour, and it has been a relief,' she said. 'I do not seem so hopeless as I was. What do you think, Laura?'</p>
<p>'Oh, Winnie, it is impossible Reginald can care for any one but you. Be as resolute as you like against Madame Moscynska, but control yourself, and Reginald will respect you all the more. He is only amused with a clever companion. You see, as soon as she is out of sight
he forgets her.'</p>
<p>'He seems to do so; but I am growing to distrust him and everything; and as to self-control, that woman has the most diabolical power of stinging me with words no one else can understand. Now last night no one save ourselves, or perhaps Reginald, could understand why I grew
so angry; but her audacity in reminding me of my not always interpreting notes aright was more than I could bear. Now I must run away. Come to me soon; the day after to-morrow.'</p>
<p>'Yes, if I can. Good-bye. Be patient, dearest Winnie, patient and strong; these evil days will pass away.'</p>
<p>'Adieu, my own wise Laura.'</p>
<p>A hearty kiss, and she was gone.</p>
