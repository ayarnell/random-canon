<!-- Volume 3 Chapter 4 -->
<p>The new Lord of Binram occupied an elegantly furnished suite of apartments on the second flat of a house in the Canongate, near the Netherbow Port. He had arrived there early in the morning after quitting Tushielaw. By means of his private keys he had admitted himself without arousing any of his attendants, and hastily throwing off his courier disguise, he locked it up in a strong oaken chest,
which was filled with every species of garment. Then he went to bed and slept for three hours.</p>
<p>At the end of that time he jumped up, dressed himself in his most becoming gear, and proceeded to the castle.</p>
<p>As he was crossing the court, he saw Captain Lindsay, Gilbert, and three companions just dismounting. Barras at once comprehended by whom his intended victim had been rescued.</p>
<p>“It was no accident which brought them to his help, curse them !” he muttered with clenched teeth. “I will learn by whose instructions they made the journey, and if it be as I suspect, this mishap may turn to my advantage yet.”</p>
<p>He saluted one of the Gentlemen of the Guard who was passing toward the Constable’s Tower.</p>
<p>“Good morrow. Master Ogilvie ; what expedition has called you forth so early?”</p>
<p>“A frolic—a frolic, my lord,” answered Ogilvie, laughing; “and some rare sport in Ettrick Forest.”</p>
<p>“So far agate? What quarry did you ride?”</p>
<p>“A rescue; nothing more. We made first to Merlin’s Cairn, where an old jezebel waited us and led us a midnight dance through the forest till we came upon a comrade who was sorely put to’t for his life. We brought him off scatheless, and left a few cracked crowns behind us.”</p>
<p>“Who started the game?”</p>
<p>“Aha, there lies the merit of it all—but, in your ear, it was a fair friend of our Captain.”</p>
<p>Barras nodded his head, and looked wondrous wise.</p>
<p>“My hand upon it. Master Ogilvie, but I will discover the dame at one guess.”</p>
<p>“Say it, then.”</p>
<p>Barras whispered, nodded, and the guardsman, laughing, went on his way. The schemer’s face darkened as, with hands clasped behind his back and head bowed, he slowly crossed the court.</p>
<p>“It was as I thought,” he muttered; “but how came she to know that he was in peril? Does she suspect me, and did she see me quit the castle? Or did her knowledge spring from tender anxiety for his safety? Hum—that must be it. We shall see how my Lord of Angus, the husband of a Queen, will take this fancy of his sister for a nameless adventurer.”</p>
<p>All the venom of his nature was expressed in the sneering bitterness with which he pronounced the words. He sought an immediate interview with Angus, and his lordship readily granted the request of one who appeared to serve him with so much fidelity.</p>
<p>The suite of chambers occupied by her Majesty’s husband were in the massive pile called David’s Tower. Douglas, whose haughty spirit, love of power, and the pomp of power, overshot his caution, and tended directly to the calamities which soon fell
upon himself and his mistress, with an impatient gesture dismissed the chamberlain who had conducted Barras to his presence.</p>
<p>“What tidings, Binram, and from whence?” said the Earl immediately after the door closed.</p>
<p>“Ill tidings, my lord, and from Ettrick,” responded Barras, with the servility of tone and manner which flattered his master more than words could ever have done.</p>
<p>“Pronounce them promptly, then; for ill tidings swiftly told may turn to goodly counsel, and so win the battle.”</p>
<p>“Saints grant that it may be so in your lordship’s case,” exclaimed the hypocrite, with earnestness so well feigned that Angus was completely imposed upon by it.</p>
<p>“Ha! whence comes the storm your prayer portends?” he said quickly, fixing his eyes upon the man.</p>
<p>Barras seemed to check himself as if afraid to pronounce the words which had been on his tongue, and lowering his eyes to the floor, said quietly—</p>
<p>“Spens escaped.”</p>
<p>“Well, if he has quitted the country the King’s pardon will protect him, so let him go.”</p>
<p>“But it is supposed that he was shot in attempting to escape.”</p>
<p>“Then Arran has one friend the less.”</p>
<p>“But, by the negligence of his Majesty’s courier, the pardon was lost.”</p>
<p>“Since the man is dead there is no need for the pardon.”</p>
<p>“Shall Elliot go unpunished?”</p>
<p>Angus surveyed the speaker curiously, as if comprehending that something lay beneath the question. He spoke slowly.</p>
<p>“Master Elliot risked his head to obtain the pardon, and little as I like him, I will answer for him that if he failed to deliver the pardon it was none of his blame. I will not ask you how his mishap befell. Still, were it shown that he had been careless in his embassy, it were enough to degrade him from the ranks of the guard. But I seek not that, for I have need of friends, not enemies; besides, he is a stout youth, and a favourite with her Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Know you why?”</p>
<p>“For no other reason, I imagine, than that he is a comely fellow and devoted to her service.”</p>
<p>Barras smiled dubiously, and instantly made an effort to suppress the smile.</p>
<p>“Does your lordship know how this Master Elliot first obtained his appointment to the guard?”</p>
<p>“For some service he had rendered to Lady Margaret Douglas, I believe.”</p>
<p>“Hum—and when your lordship was furnished with substantial grounds for suspecting that he was in the pay of my Lord of Arran, and you took occasion of his desertion to have him condemned—does your lordship know by whose intercession he was saved, even at the hour of execution?”</p>
<p>“Mistress Douglas interceded for him.”</p>
<p>“And does your lordship see nothing in all that?” exclaimed Barras, with an affectation of difficulty in subduing his surprise.</p>
<p>“Nothing, save that the lady is grateful.”</p>
<p>But the Earl’s brow darkened as if he saw more than lie desired to admit, even to himself.</p>
<p>“Then I have nothing more to say, and only wait your lordship’s commands to take my leave.”</p>
<p>He spoke as one who, anxious to do his friend a service, discovers that the service is unappreciated ; and he closed his thin lips tightly as if resolved not to speak more on that subject.</p>
<p>“The eagle scents the carrion afar off,” said Angus, frowning: “and by my faith I scent unpleasant matter behind what you have spoken. Proceed, then—what is’t?”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, my lord, I have no more to say,” was the embarrassed answer.</p>
<p>The Earl gripped him by the arm and led him to the centre casement.</p>
<p>“Look out and tell me what you see below.”</p>
<p>“The loch, shadowed by the precipice.”</p>
<p>“The precipice is two hundred feet in height, this tower is forty more, and I would hurl from the battlements the man who breathed suspicion on my honour with as little care as I should crush the wasp that stung me.”</p>
<p>“I do not understand your lordship.”</p>
<p>“My sister’s honour is precious in my eyes as my own. Your insinuations point to her. You shall speak your meaning clearly, then, before you budge one step hence.”</p>
<p>“I desire to serve your lordship,” was the humble rejoinder; “for to your powerful aid I am indebted for the title I bear and the lands I own.”</p>
<p>“Speak, then.” (Gloomily.)</p>
<p>“I came hither with that intent, and would have told you everything, but that your lordship made me believe that you looked with favourable eye upon the passion your sister bears this Master Elliot.”</p>
<p>“‘Sdeath,” cried Angus, starting furiously, “by what word or look could I give you to think that I would stand by and see my sister won by a nameless hind.”</p>
<p>“I see that I have been mistaken, and that your lordship has failed to note what every hireling of the castle makes his common gossip.”</p>
<p>“By every saint in heaven, if this he as you say, the loon shall pay dearly for daring to lift his eyes to a daughter of Douglas. Go on, man ; let me know all, and speedily.”</p>
<p>“I fear that he has not only dared to lift his eyes, but has spoken and been heard with favour.”</p>
<p>“Presumptuous cur!”</p>
<p>Angus paced the chamber with rapid strides, his countenance black with rage.</p>
<p>“It was but now,” Barras continued, in a subdued voice like the low hissing of a serpent, “that Master Ogilvie of the guard acquainted me that, by request of Mistress Douglas, Captain Lindsay, with six gentlemen, started yestereven for Ettrick Forest
to protect her ladyship’s favoured one from some anticipated peril. Do you but note her face when Elliot is near as I have done, and you will be blind indeed if you fail to find the proof of this—she loves him.”</p>
<p>“Something I have noted that this confirms,” muttered the Earl between his clenched teeth.</p>
<p>He continued for some minutes to pace the floor as if trying to bring his passion under control. Barras furtively from beneath his heavy brows watched him the while.</p>
<p>At length he halted in front of Barras and looked him fixedly in the face.</p>
<p>“I know you bear this youth no good will, Barras.”</p>
<p>“My lord?”</p>
<p>“Tush, man ! do not affect to deny it. For some reason, known only to yourself, you bear him a grudge, and have twice before set me against him. This time I would discredit you, but that my own
suspicions tally with your assertions.”</p>
<p>“I am sure of that. I have no object in calumniating the youth, but that my interest in your lordship—”</p>
<p>“Chut! I will put your assertions and
your fidelity to the proof. If the first be true, this hind shall be degraded and turned hence like a stray cur after a whipping. Then your fidelity must devise means to put him for ever beyond the power of communicating with Mistress Douglas.”</p>
<p>Barras bowed low.</p>
<p>“I accept the trust, and if I might suggest—”</p>
<p>“Well, go on.”</p>
<p>“If I might suggest the means, I think Mistress Douglas might readily be cured of any silly regard she may entertain for the youth.”</p>
<p>“She shall forget him at my bidding—if she ever thought of him otherwise than as a useful vassal.”</p>
<p>Barras shrugged his shoulders and looked doubtful.</p>
<p>“Women are weak yet so strong, or obstinate you may call it, in these matters,” he said deprecatingly, “that an attempt to force her ladyship’s will may act as the wind upon a spark of fire on a heath: it may blow out the spark, but the chances are that it will fan it into a blaze that
will consume all it meets.”</p>
<p>“You have something to propose?”</p>
<p>“I have. If it might please you, there is a simple but effective way to cure her of this folly—always supposing that she has been guilty of it,” he added hastily.</p>
<p>“Name the remedy, and you shall have thanks for your craft.”</p>
<p>“Let her see him degraded and dishonoured. That will be one step toward a cure; for, women when they love, and ere they wed, make idols of their lovers:
but you have only to present them the idol in a mean light and—phew!—away goes love with the gorgeous trappings which gave it zest.”</p>
<p>“That may serve.”</p>
<p>“If that be not enough, then send her ladyship for a little while to the priory of St. Margaret, where in solitude she will right speedily come to a sense of her own waywardness and folly.”</p>
<p>“It shall be as you say; and on the instant I will about the work. Await me here.”</p>
<p>Angus strode from the apartment, and Barras coolly seated himself with a sneering smile. He smoothed his close-shaven chin meditatively, the while he muttered with intense self-gratification—</p>
<p>“So I pull the string, and the puppet dances to the tune that pleases me. He will to his sister straight, upbraid her with her passion for a poor hireling; and whether she feel it or no, her spirit, haughty as his own, will rise in such indignation as will be to him proof strong as knowledge of my words. Next he will to her Majesty, and if she heed him one degree as much as I credit her, Master Elliot’s good fortune will play him an ill turn. Then to the priory. Mistress Mary, and once there, I shall find means to reconcile even the proud Douglas to an alliance with the Lord of Binram.”</p>
<p>Cool, cunning, and utterly selfish, this man recognized in the success of one evil scheme only the stepping-stone to another; alike indifferent to the fate of high or low, of kindred or stranger, so that his own ends were attained.</p>
